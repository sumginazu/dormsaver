Rated 5 out of 5A by ReDone Great industrial fan!! Best fan we could have bought for the money. We have an antique, vintage retail store in an old warehouse that does not have heat or air. So we bought two of these fans and they have been a lifesaver. Our customers have commented on how strong the output on the fans are. They have definitely done their job!! June 11, 2014. Rated 3 out of 5A by Customer Fans are okay, not the same durable industrial quality as original model. Fan performs well. Not as durable as original models, fan lasts around 1 year in a factory. The screws securing the protective screens vibrate loose, the stand breaks, etc. We have several of the original models that are 5+ years old, which have heavier gauge steel and better construction techniques, that still work great. August 5, 2014. Rated 4 out of 5A by avargas Good fan. Buying more. The fan moves a good amount of air. Ready to go, right out of the box. Price was very fair. June 11, 2014. Rated 1 out of 5A by dissapointed Don't waste your time or money! Just bought this fan for home use and outdoor deck cooling. Immediately after removing it from the box, it was one issue after another. First and foremost the packaging as many other people have said is horrible. there is no foam padding available and no bracing to protect the fan's thin outer housing. So the housing of the fan is pitted in and bent out of circle, the guard is bent out of shape, and the fan isn't properly balanced(it wobbles). Not to mention the overall poor quality of manufacturing and cheap design. At this price it's a joke that this unit is on the shelves. I would expect something like this from a garage sale for no more than $10. So to recap; seriously don't recommend. -Disappointed Customer August 26, 2014. Rated 4 out of 5A by Tony Good product Nice fan.i use it outside when cutting brick or inside when working on the house without AC.
