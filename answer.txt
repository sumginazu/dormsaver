The iPhone 5S (marketed with a stylized lowercase 's' as iPhone 5s) is a smartphone developed by Apple Inc. It is part of the iPhone line, and was released on September 20, 2013. Apple held an event to formally introduce the high-range phone, and its mid-range counterpart, the iPhone 5C, on September 10, 2013. As with the principle of the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4S, the iPhone 5S is a revised version of its predecessor, iPhone 5. The phone maintains a very similar design to its predecessor, aside from the introduction of a new home button design using a laser-cut sapphire cover surrounded by a metallic ring, Touch ID, a fingerprint recognition system built directly into the home button which can be used to unlock the phone and authenticate App Store and iTunes Store purchases, and an updated camera with a larger aperture and a dual-LED flash optimized for different color temperatures. It also introduced the A7 dual-core processor, the first 64-bit (ARMv8-A) processor to be used on a smartphone, accompanied by the M7 "motion co-processor", a dedicated processor for processing motion data from its accelerometer and gyroscopes without requiring the attention of the main processor. It was also the first Apple device to ship with the newest version of the iOS mobile operating system, iOS 7, which introduced a revamped visual appearance and other new features. Reception towards the device was generally positive, with some outlets considering it to be best smartphone available on the market due to its upgraded hardware, Touch ID, and other changes introduced by iOS 7. However, others criticized iPhone 5S for being too similar to its predecessors, while others showed security concerns about the Touch ID system. The iPhone 5S, along with iPhone 5C, sold nine million units on their weekend of release, breaking Apple's sales record for iPhones. The iPhone 5S was the best selling phone on all major US carriers in September 2013. On September 9, 2014, the iPhone 5S was discontinued as Apple's flagship mobile phone and was succeeded by the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
