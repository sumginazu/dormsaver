If you like phones you can easily use one-handed then the iPhone 6 wins out. iOS 8 is also a big step up and is a slicker experience than the TouchWiz heavy interface on the S5. The Samsung is more customisable but the iPhone is smoother and easier to use. That's where the benefits of the iPhone 6 end. The Galaxy S5 may not feel as premium but it it water resistant, has an outstanding screen (if you choose the right settings) and battery life that stands head and shoulders above Apple's phone.
