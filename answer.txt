It's a big step up from the Galaxy S4, offering loads of improvements over its predecessor. There's a better camera, a greatly improved AMOLED screen and a fingerprint scanner. The latter is finickety, it's no-where near as slick as Touch ID on the iPhone. The headline-grabbing feature of the Samsung Galaxy S5 is its water-resistance which means that you can happily use it in the bathroom or near at the beach without the constant worry of water damage.
